    <p>We give you news about the current ebb and flow of educational systems and processes.</p>
  <p>Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of 
    knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include 
    storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education 
    frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also 
    educate themselves.[1] Education can take place in formal or informal settings 
    and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or 
    acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>
  <p>Education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, 
    primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.</p>
  <p>A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.
    [2] In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age.</p>
