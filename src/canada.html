            <h2>Canadian Research Adds to Worry Over an Environmental Threat the Pentagon Has Downplayed for Decades</h2>
            <p>New research by Canadian scientists into the spread of a chemical commonly used in military explosives has confirmed
                some of the worst fears of U.S. environmental regulators tracking the threat posed by the Pentagon’s handling
                of its munitions in this country. The Canadian research analyzed soil and water samples at nine sites where
                military explosives were detonated between 1990 and 2014, and came up with data about where and in what concentrations
                the explosive compound known as RDX, a possible human carcinogen, had turned up. Calling RDX “an internationally
                known problem,” which “has led to an international warning on possible soil, surface water, and groundwater
                contamination on military training sites,” the research described with actual measurements how RDX floats
                on the wind and seeps through soils into water supplies. The researchers took water samples from groundwater
                at the explosives sites and found that in 26 out of 36 samples, the RDX that had made its way into aquifers
                exceeded levels considered safe. As a result, the researchers suggest that the data can be used to model
                RDX contamination at any site where munitions are routinely detonated, and for the first time, give environmental
                experts a way to quantify how much of it is spreading into surrounding communities.</p>

            <p>RDX was considered a major military breakthrough when it was first developed for large-scale use on the eve of
                World War II, and to this day it remains a staple of the U.S. military’s war-making abilities, used in bombs,
                missiles and other weapons. And for decades, the Pentagon has known about RDX’s potential health and environmental
                threat. But the Pentagon has long maintained that the risk is not great, and it has both financed research
                and flexed its political muscle to have its view prevail. Most recently, the Pentagon has waged an intense
                fight to not have the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency upgrade its classification of RDX’s health threat,
                a move that could expose the Department of Defense to billions of added dollars in cleanup costs.</p>
            <p>At a minimum, the Canadian research — published Nov. 17 in the Journal of Environmental Quality — will add to
                the store of knowledge about RDX contamination. The research found that while the highest concentrations
                of RDX remained in a ring around the sites where munitions had exploded, pieces of explosive, perhaps as
                large as a centimeter, were carried on the wind and later settled in the soil. Surface and groundwater samples
                showed that the RDX ultimately did not quickly dissolve or degrade as it sank deeper into the earth, where
                it usually was carried into water supplies. Harry Craig, one of the Environmental Protection Agency’s foremost
                experts on explosives contamination, has described RDX as the single greatest problem the U.S. faces when
                it comes to cleaning up thousands of toxic munitions sites across the country. In an email to agency colleagues,
                Craig described the Canadian research as both novel and useful. ProPublica reported on the history of RDX
                and the Department of Defense’s long-standing campaign to minimize its risks and fight EPA regulation in
                December. RDX has been discovered at dozens of U.S. defense sites, and increasingly in public drinking water
                supplies around them. After early research by the U.S. Army determined that RDX was likely responsible for
                cancerous tumors in rats and mice, the Department of Defense has produced dozens of reports portraying RDX
                as more benign.</p>
            <p>The new report from Canadian scientists confirms some things that the Pentagon had long sought to deny: that
                RDX contamination was likely to be present in most places where munitions were exploded or detonated, and
                that once it was present in soil, RDX moved easily into water supplies. The Canadian findings suggest that
                RDX contamination on or around defense sites in the U.S. could be even more widespread than is already known.
                The Canadian report, authored by researchers at the Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, Centre
                Eau, Terre et Environnement, and at Defence Research and Development Canada, both in Quebec, lists several
                U.S. sites with concentrations of RDX contamination that had not been previously disclosed in environmental
                data the Pentagon had provided to ProPublica. At Fort Hood, in Texas, RDX was present at dangerous levels.
                The same was true at Fort Greely in Alaska and Fort Bliss in New Mexico. If you have experience with or information

            <p>Abrahm Lustgarten is a senior environmental reporter, with a focus at the intersection of business, climate and
                energy. His 2015 series examining the causes of water scarcity in the American West, “Killing the Colorado,”
                was a finalist for the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for national reporting and received the 2016 Keck Futures Initiative
                Communication Award from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Lustgarten co-produced
                the 2016 Discovery Channel film “Killing the Colorado,” and has previously worked with PBS Frontline, including
                on the 2010 documentary “The Spill,” about how BP’s corporate culture of recklessness and profiteering led
                to the Deepwater Horizon tragedy. That film was nominated for an Emmy. His early investigation into the environmental
                and economic consequences of fracking was some of the first coverage of the issue, and received the George
                Polk award for environmental reporting, the National Press Foundation award for best energy writing, a Sigma
                Delta Chi award and was honored as finalist for the Goldsmith Prize.</p>
            <p>Before joining ProPublica in 2008, Lustgarten was a staff writer at Fortune. His work has appeared in The New
                York Times, The Washington Post, The Atlantic, Scientific American, Wired, Salon, and Esquire, among other
                publications. He is the author of two books; “Run to Failure: BP and the Making of the Deepwater Horizon
                Disaster,” and also “China’s Great Train: Beijing’s Drive West and the Campaign to Remake Tibet,” a project
                that was funded in part by a grant from the MacArthur Foundation. Lustgarten earned a master’s in journalism
                from Columbia University in 2003 and a bachelor’s degree in anthropology from Cornell.</p>
