            <p>Ken Norton Jr, who was fired by the Raiders after week 11 this past season, has found a new home. He lands on his feet across The Bay with the San Francisco 49ers, the team announced today.</p>
            <p>Norton gets a promotion of sorts as he’s been named Assistant Head Coach - Defense as well as Inside Linebackers coach.</p> 
            <p>“Ken brings a great deal of knowledge and experience to our team having spent more than two decades as a NFL player and coach,” 49ers Head Coach Kyle Shanahan said in a statement. “Throughout his coaching career, Ken has developed a tremendous understanding of our defensive system, making him a perfect fit for our staff. With four Super Bowl titles on his resume, including one as a 49er, Ken knows firsthand what it takes to become a championship caliber team.”</p> 
            <p>Norton spent three seasons as Defensive Coordinator in Oakland under head coach Jack Del Rio, lasting 10 games into the third season. They never ranked higher than 22nd in the league in yards and 20th in points allowed during his tenure.</p>
            <p>The rest of the staff in Oakland lasted just six more games as they were ousted to make room for Jon Gruden as the new head coach along with his staff.</p>
            <p>Norton played the final seven years of his NFL playing career in San Francisco, getting his third Super Bowl ring as a player in 1994. His first two he won while with the Dallas Cowboys and his fourth as linebackers coach with the Seahawks.</p>
